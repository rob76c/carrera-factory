# Phase 6 Plan 1: Terminal Domain Consolidation Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Consolidate terminal management into src/backend/domains/terminal/

**Verified:** 2026-02-10T17:12:50Z

**Status:** PASSED

**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | All terminal operations flow through src/backend/domains/terminal/ | ✓ VERIFIED | terminal.service.ts (545 lines) exists at domain path with full TerminalService class. Shim at old path re-exports from domain. 4 consumers use old path which resolves to domain via shim. |
| 2 | Existing consumers continue to work via shim at old path | ✓ VERIFIED | Shim at src/backend/services/terminal.service.ts re-exports from '@/backend/domains/terminal/terminal.service'. 4 consumers found: app-context.ts, mcp/terminal.mcp.ts (2 imports), worktree-lifecycle.service.ts. pnpm typecheck passes. |
| 3 | TERM-02 verified satisfied: all Maps are private instance fields, no module-level mutable state | ✓ VERIFIED | 4 Maps confirmed as private instance fields: terminals, outputListeners, exitListeners, activeTerminals. Only static member is readonly constant MONITORING_INTERVAL_MS. Output buffer size controlled by module-level constant MAX_TERMINAL_OUTPUT_BUFFER_SIZE. Zero module-level mutable state. |
| 4 | Domain has co-located unit tests covering the public API (TERM-03) | ✓ VERIFIED | terminal.service.test.ts exists with 33 tests covering all 15+ public API methods. All tests pass. Coverage: createTerminal, writeToTerminal, resizeTerminal, destroyTerminal, getTerminal, getTerminalsForWorkspace, onOutput, onExit, destroyWorkspaceTerminals, cleanup, getActiveTerminalCount, setActiveTerminal, getActiveTerminal, clearActiveTerminal, getAllTerminals. |
| 5 | Domain barrel smoke test confirms exports are not undefined | ✓ VERIFIED | terminal-domain-exports.test.ts exists with 1 test verifying terminalService is defined when imported from barrel. Test passes. |
| 6 | pnpm typecheck passes | ✓ VERIFIED | pnpm typecheck completes with zero errors. All consumers resolve imports correctly. |

**Score:** 6/6 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `src/backend/domains/terminal/terminal.service.ts` | TerminalService class, terminalService singleton, 5 type exports | ✓ VERIFIED | File exists (545 lines). Contains `export class TerminalService` (line 75), singleton `export const terminalService = new TerminalService()` (line 544). Exports 5 types: CreateTerminalOptions, CreateTerminalResult, TerminalInstance, TerminalOutput, TerminalResourceUsage. |
| `src/backend/domains/terminal/index.ts` | Domain barrel with selective named exports | ✓ VERIFIED | File exists (15 lines). Exports 7 items: terminalService, TerminalService, and 5 type interfaces from './terminal.service'. Matches expected exports list in plan. |
| `src/backend/services/terminal.service.ts` | Re-export shim for backward compatibility | ✓ VERIFIED | File exists (14 lines). Contains @deprecated JSDoc. Re-exports all 7 items from '@/backend/domains/terminal/terminal.service' (direct module path, not barrel). |
| `src/backend/domains/terminal/terminal.service.test.ts` | Unit tests for TerminalService public API | ✓ VERIFIED | File exists (364 lines). Contains 33 tests in 15 describe blocks. Covers all public API methods. All tests pass (pnpm test confirms). |
| `src/backend/domains/terminal/terminal-domain-exports.test.ts` | Barrel export smoke test | ✓ VERIFIED | File exists (16 lines). Imports terminalService from barrel './index' and verifies it's defined. Test passes. |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|----|--------|---------|
| src/backend/services/terminal.service.ts | src/backend/domains/terminal/terminal.service.ts | re-export shim (direct module path, not barrel) | ✓ WIRED | Pattern found at line 13: `from '@/backend/domains/terminal/terminal.service'`. Exports all 7 items (5 types + class + singleton). |
| src/backend/domains/terminal/index.ts | src/backend/domains/terminal/terminal.service.ts | barrel re-export | ✓ WIRED | Pattern found at line 14: `from './terminal.service'`. Exports all 7 items matching plan. |
| src/backend/domains/terminal/terminal.service.ts | @/backend/services/logger.service | cross-domain absolute import | ✓ WIRED | Pattern found at line 17: `import { createLogger } from '@/backend/services/logger.service'`. Used to create logger instance at line 19. |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Blocking Issue |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| TERM-01: `src/backend/domains/terminal/` owns terminal pty management, output buffering, and monitoring | ✓ SATISFIED | None. Full TerminalService class exists at domain path with all PTY operations, output buffering (MAX_TERMINAL_OUTPUT_BUFFER_SIZE constant, outputBuffer field), and resource monitoring (monitoringInterval, updateAllTerminalResources). |
| TERM-02: Static Maps in terminal service replaced with instance-based state | ✓ SATISFIED | None. All 4 Maps are private instance fields (terminals, outputListeners, exitListeners, activeTerminals). Zero static mutable state. Only static readonly constants exist. |
| TERM-03: Terminal domain has co-located unit tests covering its public API | ✓ SATISFIED | None. 33 tests cover all 15+ public API methods. Barrel smoke test verifies exports. All tests pass. |

### Anti-Patterns Found

**None detected.**

Scanned files:
- src/backend/domains/terminal/terminal.service.ts
- src/backend/domains/terminal/index.ts
- src/backend/services/terminal.service.ts
- src/backend/domains/terminal/terminal.service.test.ts
- src/backend/domains/terminal/terminal-domain-exports.test.ts

Checks performed:
- TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER comments: None found
- Empty implementations (return null/{}[]): Only legitimate guard clauses (getTerminal returns null when workspace not found, getTerminalsForWorkspace returns [] when no terminals exist — both are correct behavior)
- Console.log-only stubs: None found
- Unwired code: All exports are imported by consumers or tests

### Human Verification Required

**None.** All verification completed programmatically.

The terminal domain is a pure backend service with no UI components. All functionality can be verified through:
1. Unit tests (33 tests covering all public API methods)
2. Type checking (pnpm typecheck passes)
3. Static analysis (imports, exports, consumers verified)
4. Full test suite regression check (1775 tests pass)

## Summary

Phase 6 Plan 1 successfully achieved its goal: **Terminal domain consolidation is complete.**

### What Was Verified

**Artifacts (5/5 passed):**
- Terminal service moved to domain with exported class + singleton
- Domain barrel populated with 7 selective exports
- Re-export shim created at old path for backward compatibility
- 33 unit tests covering all public API methods
- Barrel smoke test verifying exports are defined

**Wiring (3/3 passed):**
- Shim re-exports from direct module path (avoiding circular deps)
- Barrel re-exports from local service file
- Cross-domain import uses absolute @/ path for logger

**Requirements (3/3 satisfied):**
- TERM-01: Terminal domain owns PTY management ✓
- TERM-02: Instance-based state (no static Maps) ✓
- TERM-03: Co-located unit tests covering public API ✓

**Quality checks passed:**
- Zero anti-patterns detected
- pnpm typecheck passes
- pnpm test passes (1775 tests, 0 regressions)
- All 4 existing consumers continue to work via shim

### Commits Verified

- `5d61d79` — feat(06-01): move terminal.service.ts to domain, create shim and barrel (567 insertions, 544 deletions)
- `c3f571d` — test(06-01): add terminal domain unit tests and barrel smoke test (379 insertions)

Both commits exist in git history and match the deliverables documented in SUMMARY.md.
