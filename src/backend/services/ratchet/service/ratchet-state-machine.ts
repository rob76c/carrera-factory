/**
 * Ratchet State Machine
 *
 * `Workspace.ratchetState` is a state machine over PR observations, mirroring
 * the workspace lifecycle machine's explicit transition table. Unlike the
 * lifecycle machine, ratchet state is *derived*: each poll observes the PR on
 * GitHub (CI status, merge conflicts, review state) and persists what it saw,
 * so almost any state can follow any other — new commits restart CI, reviews
 * arrive, conflicts appear and resolve, and the workspace's PR pointer can
 * switch to a brand-new PR after the old one merged.
 *
 * The table below therefore encodes intent and acts as a tripwire for future
 * refactors rather than restricting today's graph. The enforced invariant is
 * compare-and-swap on the expected fromState at the point of persistence
 * (see workspaceRatchetService.transitionStateIfEnabled and
 * settleRatchetIdleWhileDisabled), which guarantees that emitted
 * RATCHET_STATE_CHANGED events carry an accurate fromState and that stale
 * in-flight checks cannot overwrite a concurrent transition.
