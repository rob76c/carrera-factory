# Contributing to Factory Factory

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Factory Factory! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) - authenticated
- Claude Code - authenticated via `claude login`

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/purplefish-ai/factory-factory.git
cd factory-factory

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

## Development Workflow

### Running the App

```bash
# Web app (development)
pnpm dev

# Electron app (development)
pnpm dev:electron

# Production build
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

### Code Quality

Before submitting a pull request, ensure your code passes all checks:

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Watch tests while developing
pnpm test:watch

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Lint and format
pnpm check:fix
```

### Database

```bash
# Run migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Generate Prisma client after schema changes
pnpm db:generate

# Regenerate Prisma output, validate service ownership/imports, and typecheck after schema changes
pnpm check:prisma-schema

# Open Prisma Studio
pnpm db:studio
```

### Storybook

Use Storybook for UI development and to validate component changes:

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** with clear, focused commits
3. **Run all checks** (`pnpm check`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`)
4. **Write or update tests** for your changes
5. **Add or update Storybook stories** for UI changes
6. **Update documentation** if needed
7. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Reference issues when relevant ("Fix #123")

### Code Style

- We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting
- Run `pnpm check` for standard guardrails and `pnpm check:fix` to automatically fix Biome issues
- `pnpm check` enforces Codex schema drift in CI. Locally, that check is skipped unless the pinned Codex CLI is installed; use `CODEX_SCHEMA_CHECK=strict pnpm check:codex-schema` to enforce it.
- `prisma/generated/` is generated and excluded from Biome linting. After changing `prisma/schema.prisma`, run `pnpm check:prisma-schema` to regenerate Prisma output, enforce Prisma import/ownership rules, and typecheck the resulting type surface. CI also runs `pnpm check:prisma-generated` after generation to fail if generated output is not committed.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer Zod for schemas and validation; avoid raw typecasts
